## Projects
### Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease using Data Mining Techniques 
#[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048) in medium

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Boston House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression Model 
#[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240) in medium

Used **R** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 13 variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.

### Best-Fit Distibution Model of Water Consumption
#[Publication](https://ir.uitm.edu.my/id/eprint/50164/)

Conducted a study to determine the optimal distribution model for water consumption data using a dataset of 221 locations in 2017. Employed the normal, lognormal, and loglogistic distributions, estimating their parameters through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Least Square Estimation (LSE) methods. Identified that LSE provided superior parameter estimation based on a smaller Mean Square Error (MSE) and employed Anderson-Darling goodness of fit for model selection.
