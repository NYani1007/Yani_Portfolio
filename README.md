## Projects
### Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease using Data Mining Techniques 
#[Medium](https://medium.com/@noriszayyani97/prediction-of-cardiovascular-disease-using-data-mining-techniques-e56fc2d1442a)

Applied **RapidMiner** tools to conduct a comprehensive study to identify the optimal data mining technique for cardiovascular disease prediction using a dataset of 70,000 observations and 11 key risk factors. Employed Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, coupled with feature selection wrapper methods, ultimately determining that Decision Tree with Optimize Selection yielded the best performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 73.34% along with high precision, sensitivity, and specificity."

### Best-Fit Distibution Model of Water Consumption
#[Publication](https://ir.uitm.edu.my/id/eprint/50164/)

Conducted a study to determine the optimal distribution model for water consumption data using a dataset of 221 locations in 2017. Employed the normal, lognormal, and loglogistic distributions, estimating their parameters through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Least Square Estimation (LSE) methods. Identified that LSE provided superior parameter estimation based on a smaller Mean Square Error (MSE) and employed Anderson-Darling goodness of fit for model selection.
